        <p>
          A fire hydrant system is a critical piece of infrastructure for any
          building or industrial site. It is a network of pipes, valves and
          outlets connected to an underground water supply that can provide a
          reliable source of water during a fire emergency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Commercial buildings and industrial sites are required to have a
          functioning fire hydrant system installed on their premises. This
          includes the installation of water supply pipelines and fire hydrants
          at strategic locations so that fire fighters can connect their hoses
          to the nearest fire hydrant to access the water supply.
